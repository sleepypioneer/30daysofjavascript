# 30 Days of JavaScript

I plan to complete the challenge alongside the current JavaScript and Web development course I am taking here in Berlin. 

You can read about my progress my blog page https://sleepypioneer.wordpress.com/ and below see the projects as I complete them. The idea of JavaScript 30 is to code to completion 30 projects using vanilla JavaScript code, from a Drum Kit to a 'Wack a Mole' game. 

If you want to also take the challenge you can join here: https://javascript30.com/ 

### Server

A node server is used for this app. From the command line run "npm install" and then either "server.sh" if you are on a linux box or "server.bat" if you are on a windows box.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser. You may have to add the page to the url such as EventDetails.html depending on where you are at in the course. The port may be configured either in the node server or on IIS.
